# Rhythm Trainer

![Current version's screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/XxYK2ZV.png)

Rhythm Trainer is a straight-forward tool to generate Rhythm exercises. It allows you to customize what kind of rhythmic figures can appear.

Right now, it is in a quite simple state at the moment, and lots of things are still buggy.

## Setup:

Requirements:


Python 3.10, PyQt5, Lilypond



Download the source code from here, and download Lilypond (https://lilypond.org/download.html). Place the lilypond folder inside the source folder.
Then, just run 'python main.py' and the UI should appear.


## Current problems and future updates:


This project is the product of quite a spotaneous idea, primarely for my own practice. As such, any bugs and problems are not currently a big priority for me. 
Still, here is the list of current problems:


- Some notes appear appear incorrectly tied, due to my usage of Lilypond


- No image size limits are currently implemented


As for the future ideas:

- I wanted to make the sheet interactible, where you could hear the correct playback and try to play it yourself and get evaluated.
